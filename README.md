This is a simple C language Chip8 emulator I've written to try and test myself on the basics of C. This project is for my portfolio and doesn't serve a purpose other than refining my programming skills in a project that I will enjoy, but ultimately not have much use for after I finish. Included in the project is a simple interpreter written in C using SDL2 for the interfacce, and much simpler assembler written in C# using WPF for interface. There is no documentation for the Assembler as this was just for personal use with debugging. Included in the submodules is a repository called chip8-test-suite that I have found helpful in assuring that the interpreter works as intended.
